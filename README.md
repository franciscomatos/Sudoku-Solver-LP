# Sudoku Solver

This project consists on a program written in PROLOG for solving Sudoku problems. A Sudoku problem of size *n* (n is a number whose square root is an integer) is a matrix *n* x *n*, where each position has a number between 1 and *n* or it's empty. The goal is to fill all the empty positions with numbers between 1 and *n*, so that each group (row, column or block) contains every number.
